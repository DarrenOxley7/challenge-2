# Building my portfolio page(challenge-2)

## Description

### The Task

I was tasked with creating a portfolio page for myself using the skills I have learnt so far, whilst meeting the minimum requirements. These were:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

I focussed most of my efforts on using the Grid display type in my css, although there are some flex types in there too. It's also the first time I have used @media tags to refactor webpages for smaller screens. It's not perfect at the moment but I'm sure I'll improve with time. 

## Usage

To access the website, navigate to [my portfolio webpage ](https://darrenoxley7.github.io/challenge-2/). There is a nav menu at the top right which will navigate to the relevant area of the page. There are also links in the Contact Me section, however these are only for demontation purposes. 

I do not have a Twitter or Facebook account so these are set to link to their respective homepages. The Phone link will call "0" and the Email link will add an example email address to the recipient field in a users preferred email account. It is my intention to update these links as I progress.

## Installation

To view the code navigate to the website using the link above and right click on any website element and cick inspect or download the source code from [My GitHub repo](https://github.com/DarrenOxley7/challenge-2.git) and open the index.html file in VS Code.
